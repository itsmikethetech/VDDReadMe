# Virtual Display Driver
This project creates a _virtual display_ in Windows that functions just like a physical monitor. It is particularly useful for applications such as **streaming, virtual reality, screen recording,** and **headless servers‚Äîsystems** that operate without a physical display attached. 

Unlike physical monitors, this virtual display can support resolutions and refresh rates that go beyond standard hardware limitations, offering greater flexibility for advanced setups. Furthermore, custom EDIDs can be used to simulate/emulate existing hardware displays.

## Download Latest Version

- [Driver Installer (Windows 10/11)](https://github.com/VirtualDisplay/Virtual-Display-Driver/releases) - Check release page for release notes.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before using the Virtual Display Driver, ensure the following dependencies are installed:
> - **Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable**  
>   If you encounter the error `vcruntime140.dll not found`, download and install the latest version from the [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable page](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170).

## EDID Database
- [EDID Database by Bud3699](https://edid.mikethetech.com/)

  You can use this database to load custom edid's into the driver! Or just general edid usage :) 

## Installation

- Step 1: Download the Installer
   - You can download the insaller directly from the [Releases](https://github.com/VirtualDisplay/Virtual-Display-Driver/releases) page.

- Step 2: Run the Installer
   - Download and run the installer.
   - Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

- Step 3: Verify the Installation (Optional)
   - Check if the Virtual Display Driver is correctly installed by running the following:
   - **Device Manager:** Check "Device Manager" under "Display Adapters."
   - **Settings:** Check display settings under system settings and see if the virtual displays show.

Manual installation can be found in the wiki
